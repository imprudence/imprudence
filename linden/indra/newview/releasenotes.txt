Release Notes for Second Life 1.20.15 July 23rd, 2008
=====================================

New features:
* An improved architecture for the user interface (UI) which now supports:
** Enhancements to the UI texture rendering system
** Ability to customize text color of Instant Messages
** Ability to reference textures by filename rather than UUID
** Support for non-powers-of-two textures
** Support for PNG textures

* The viewer installs with a choice between two color themes ("skins") for the User Interface: 
** This can be changed in Preferences > Skins (It requires a restart of the viewer to take effect.)
** A new "Silver" skin refreshes the visual design of user interface with a lighter color scheme and improved UI graphics

* The Tools menu is now hidden by default:
** It displays in the top menu bar ONLY when editing/creating objects in build mode:
** To enter build mode: click on the Build button, or right-click and select Create.
** Existing tool short cuts (CTL + 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) all still work to select a specific tool, and will also activate the Tools menu.

* Improvements to Search:
** Classified ads have a drop-down menu to indicate Mature or Not Mature content
** Search > Popular Places is replaced by a Search > Showcase tab that points to the web-based Showcase
** Search > Groups now uses web-based search which dramatically improves relevant matches on multi-word queries, and reduces load on the central database
*** NOTE:  The new Search > Groups does eliminate the ability to sort results alphabetically or by Group member count, as was possible in Viewer version 1.19.1.

* Improved internationalization support:
** Improved unicode system font support good Linux
** The Preferences > General > Language: 'System Default' option works on Linux and Windows.
*** If you have a non-English language Operating System, and have not previously selected "English" as your chosen language option in the viewer, this viewer will default to your Operating System's language!

* Clicking on resident names in Local Chat or in a Group IM will open their Profile page
** The color of clickable resident names uses the same color as URL hyperlinks in chat. These may be changed in Preferences > Text Chat > color picker for "URLs"

* Newly created avatars without a gender, or any avatar where "clothing is still downloading", are rendered as a cloud rather than naked/wrong body shape

* Added beta support for basic voice lipsync for voice visualization - via Advanced menu > Character > Enable Lip Sync (Beta)

* Fly button is now shown as disabled when you are sitting

* LSL scripting for object glow
** A prim's glow attribute can be controlled by scripts. Additional documentation is found at http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlSetPrimitiveParams

* Improved Joystick and 3D input device support:
** Integrated a new open source library created by 3Dconnexion designed to integrate multi-axis input devices with Second Life
** Joystick devices can now control the Avatar, Edited Objects, or the Flycam (View menu > Joystick Flycam)
** Added a "Joystick Setup" window to the Preferences > Input & Camera tab; for adjusting multi axis input devices
*** The settings are currently optimized for Logitech's 3Dconnexion SpaceNavigator but should be tunable for any joystick or 3D input device

* Added five texture constants for referencing in llSetLinkTexture:
** TEXTURE_BLANK is the non-transparent blank texture, equivalent to UUID "5748decc-f629-461c-9a36-a35a221fe21f"
** TEXTURE_DEFAULT is the default plywood texture, equivalent to UUID "89556747-24cb-43ed-920b-47caed15465f"
** TEXTURE_PLYWOOD is the default plywood texture, equivalent to UUID "89556747-24cb-43ed-920b-47caed15465f"
** TEXTURE_TRANSPARENT is a fully transparent texture, equivalent to UUID "8dcd4a48-2d37-4909-9f78-f7a9eb4ef903"
** TEXTURE_MEDIA is the default Media texture, equivalent to UUID "8b5fec65-8d8d-9dc5-cda8-8fdf2716e361"
** Note: TEXTURE_DEFAULT is a synonym for TEXTURE_PLYWOOD
** Note on Compatibility:
*** Scripts using these constants will run smoothly in all Second Life viewers, however previous versions of the viewer will NOT be able to edit
    and recompile scripts using the new constants. Older versions will report "(XX,YY) : ERROR : Name not defined within scope" when trying to
    compile such a script.
*** If you are using an older version of the viewer that does not support the TEXTURE_ contants and want to edit and recompile scripts with a TEXTURE_ constant,
    then you have to revert to the earlier LSL requirement to use the UUID of the texture you want to use.
*** The TEXTURE_TRANSPARENT texture will be gray unless you view it with a viewer that supports this transparent texture (viewer 1.20.10 or above).

* Thread monitoring to catch freezes for beta/Release Candidate versions of the viewer:
** A new thread monitor (also referred to as a Watchdog) will detect when the viewer application frozen for a period greater than 20 seconds and possibly force a crash with detailed logs
** Thread monitoring is only enabled on beta versions of the viewer, and for Windows only
** Thread monitoring can be disabled by choosing to never report crashes, or with a command line setting "--set WatchdogEnabled 0"
** The threshold timing of the thread monitor is set in the file /app_settings/settings.xml under the key "MainloopTimeoutDefault"

KNOWN ISSUES:
* This 1.20 Viewer will not run on a Mac PowerPC that is running Mac OS X 10.3.9.  The minimum requirements for running Second Life
is using Mac OS X 10.4.11 or higher. Please see http://secondlife.com/support/sysreqs.php for more information.
** The 1.19.1 Viewer still supports the Mac PowerPC that is running Mac OS X 10.3.9.

* There is a known issue in the 1.20 Viewer on Macs using Apple's USB Mighty Mouse and a 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator. The Mighty Mouse will be erroneously detected as a
joystick and the primary mouse button will toggle "Flycam" with unusual behavior. Therefore the support for the 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator in Second Life does not yet
extend to Macs using a USB Mighty Mouse.
WORKAROUND: You must use a different mouse in order to use a 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator in Second Life without problem.

* Second Life is currently unable to run under native Korean-language Windows XP if the WindowsXP username uses default Korean characters
WORKAROUND:  create a Windows XP username on this computer that uses Latin characters.  We are investigating this issue!

* VWR-6363: In the 1.20 Viewer, there are known issues with camera behavior and/or button-mapping behavior when using the 3DConnexion SpaceNavigator in a
combination of "Flycam" and Build modes under some circumstances.

* VWR-5749: When running Second Life in Full Screen mode on computers with some NVIDIA graphics cards, you may be unable to scroll up/down on webpages
that are shown inworld.  This includes the web-based interfaces of Search > All tab, and Search > Groups tab.  We are investigating this issue.
WORKAROUND: You must run Second Life in a window to avoid this problem. Go to Preferences > Graphics > Run Second Life in a window.

* VWR-7779: On some Macs, there are reports of periodic and cyclic freezing of the computer when running Viewer 1.20.
WORKAROUND #1: One workaround is to reduce the Draw Distance below 128m in Preferences > Graphics tab > Custom > Draw Distance (slider). Also if you have Disabled Camera Constraints
from the Advanced menu, behavior is improved if you do not Disable Camera Constraints.
WORKAROUND #2: One workaround that may help is to use an additional argument "-set YieldTime 20" in the Arguments.txt:
** To set this argument, right-click (or control-click) the Second Life application and choose "Show package contents".
** In the resulting finder window, open Resources and in there should be a file named "arguments.txt". Open in text edit, add the argument to the end of the line in there and Save.
** Close the text edit and run Second Life application.
** This causes the viewer to sleep for 20 milliseconds every frame. It will slow the frame rate down a little, but may help with freezing.


Release Notes for Second Life 1.19.1(4) April 2nd, 2008
=====================================
New features and changes:

* Physically accurate atmospheric rendering and lighting (previously code named WindLight)
** Animateable day cycles
** Vastly improved realistic water with reflections and glimmer
** "Glow" as new object attribute
** Avatar Impostoring, which can speed up crowded scenes tremendously
** A new cleaned-up, easy to use Graphics Preferences tab with simple and advanced options for performance/quality settings

* Parcel Media - adds the ability to display Web based media on a parcel
** New API for Media Rendering
** Enables Web content inworld
** Added two new click actions, one for playing movies, and one for opening media
** Embedded web browser
** Added support for Media resizing

* Estate-Level Abuse Reporting
** Estate owners and managers now have the ability (under World > Region/Estate) to enter an email address where abuse reports will be sent. 
** If this address is empty, abuse reports will go to Linden Lab as usual. If the address is present, the abuse reports will be sent there instead. In both cases, all abuse reports are logged by Linden Lab.

* Voice changes
** Changed the default voice volume to be a bit higher, to better match the volume of in-world sounds 
** Changed the voice volume slider to default to the middle of its range, so voice volume can be boosted above the default

* Improved Linux Voice support
** Better support for USB headsets and other devices
** Better voice audio quality

* Additional rendering optimizations:
** Faster, more reliable occlusion culling - occluded regions are discovered instantaneously, eliminating random bad frames due to the camera moving too quickly
** No geometry transform overhead on region crossing - results in region crossings being slightly smoother
** Faster frustum culling - less time is spent determining what's visible, thus giving better overall framerates
** No copy-to-texture for ripple water - objects under water are rendered to texture at half resolution, resulting in better overall framerates
** Faster sky updates - the non-WindLight (aka no-shader) skies update quicker - even faster than the pre-WindLight skies!
** Single pass shiny when using shaders - making an object shiny will no longer require it to be rendered twice, which results in virtually free shiny functionality from a performance standpoint
** Single pass terrain when using shaders - the terrain is no longer drawn in two passes, which, from a performance standpoint, results in virtually free high detail terrain for shader friendly cards (See the System Recommendations at http://secondlife.com/corporate/sysreqs.php)
** Improved object update code (less work for the CPU) - attachments are no longer added to the active list, which improves performance in crowded areas
** Better scheduling of Avatar LOD (Level of Detail) updates - Avatar LOD is now calculated every 16 frames as opposed to every single frame, which removes redundant work
** Better Avatar culling through more accurate bounding boxes - Avatar bounding boxes now match their current animation, resulting in more optimized culling of avatars that are not visible in the frame
** Better tree rendering (70% fewer matrix operations, no reliance on GL matrix stack) - results in improved performance for tree rendering
** Trimmed unused state in LLDrawable, LLSpatialGroup, LLOctree, and LLFace - results in memory savings
** 16-bit index buffers are now used instead of 32-bit buffers - improves memory bandwidth for rendering geometry
** For more information, see: https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/WindLight
